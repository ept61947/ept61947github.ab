	<p>The ginkgo (<span style="font-style: italic">Ginkgo biloba</span>) is a medium-sized tree native to the Orient, but widely planted in
the Southestern US. The ginkgo is considered a “living fossil,” in that there are no closely
related species still extant. Ginkgos are prized for their vivid yellow fall leaves.</p><p>An unusual biological feature of the ginkgo is that it is a gymnosperm (“naked seed”),
meaning that the ginkgo seed is not encased in a fruit. In this the ginkgo resembles pine trees,
although the ginkgo is deciduous (loses its leaves in the winter).</p><p>Ginkgos can be extremely long lived; one ginkgo in Shandong province, China is estimated
to be 3,000 years old.</p><p><div style="font-size: 9pt">Source: en.wikipedia.org.</p><p>Image credit: Fisher Yu. http://www.panoramio.com/photo/61783968</div></div>
